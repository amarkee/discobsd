2.11BSD-based UNIX-like Operating System for STM32 and PIC32 Microcontrollers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DiscoBSD is a 2.11BSD-based UNIX-like operating system for microcontrollers,
with a focus on high portability to memory constrained devices without a
memory management unit.

The current and second official release of DiscoBSD is [DiscoBSD 2.1][1],
released on August 31, 2023.

This microcontroller-focused operating system is an independent continuation
of RetroBSD, a 2.11BSD-based OS targeting the MIPS-based PIC32MX7.
DiscoBSD is multi-platform, as it also supports Arm Cortex-M4 STM32F4 devices.

Source code to the system is freely available under a BSD-like license.

History
-------

[DiscoBSD][2] began as an undergraduate [Directed Study][3] in the winter of
2020 at the University of Victoria, Canada, as a case study of [RetroBSD][4]
to port the operating system to the Arm Cortex-M4 architecture, and to enable
portabilty in the hosting environment and target architectures and platforms.
The paper [*Porting the Unix Kernel*][5] details this initial porting effort.

Work on DiscoBSD has progressed in earnest since the completion of the
Directed Study, with the DiscoBSD/stm32 port booting multi-user in
August 2022. The system is quite usable on supported development boards.

And work continues...

DiscoBSD Resource Requirements
------------------------------

A basic, minimal system uses 128 Kbytes of flash and 128 Kbytes of RAM.

The kernel is loaded into the flash and only uses 32 Kbytes of RAM.
User programs each use the remaining 96 Kbytes of RAM, via swapping.
Devices with more RAM can be used to run larger user programs.

An SD card, at least 512 Mbytes in size, is required for the root file system.

Installing and Running
----------------------

Installation consists of loading the kernel into the microcontroller's flash
memory, and imaging the SD card with the file `sdcard.img`.

The `make` target `installfs` uses the `dd` utility to image the SD card
attached to the host operating system at `SDCARD`, such as `/dev/rsdXc` or
`/dev/sdX` or `/dev/rdiskX`, replacing `X` with the actual drive number or
letter, as the case may be.

For example, imaging an SD card attached at `sd2` on an OpenBSD host
operating system through the raw i/o device:

    $ SDCARD=/dev/rsd2c make installfs

Communication with the DiscoBSD console requires a serial port. A USB to TTL
device or the built-in VCP USB serial port on development boards can be used.

    $ cu -l /dev/cuaU0 -s 115200

Depending on the host system, other serial port utilities such as `screen`,
`minicom`, `putty`, or `teraterm` may be used.

Log in to DiscoBSD with user `root` and a blank password.
Shutdown DiscoBSD with the `halt`, `shutdown`, or `reboot` commands.

Manual pages for commands are available through the `man` command.

Building
--------

DiscoBSD is cross-built on UNIX-like host operating systems.

Instructions to configure an OpenBSD host development environment for
Arm and MIPS targets is available [here][6].

The build system fully supports both BSD make and GNU make.

From the source tree root, run:

    $ make

which will build a file system image in the file `distrib/stm32/sdcard.img`
and ELF-formatted kernels in the files `sys/stm32/${BOARD}/unix`.

DiscoBSD/stm32 is the default port, but DiscoBSD/pic32 may be built via:

    $ make MACHINE=pic32 MACHINE_ARCH=mips

which will build a file system image in the file `distrib/pic32/sdcard.img`
and ELF-formatted kernels in the files `sys/pic32/${BOARD}/unix` and
Intel HEX-formatted kernels in the files `sys/pic32/${BOARD}/unix.hex`.

[6]: tools/openbsd/README.md

Debugging
---------

DiscoBSD/stm32 is debugged through OpenOCD and GDB. The `make` targets for
debugging are `ocd` and `gdb-ocd`.

Debug a particular development board via:

    $ BOARD=f412gdisco make ocd

in one terminal, and:

    $ BOARD=f412gdisco make gdb-ocd

in another terminal.

Additional Information
----------------------

Port-specific information can be found in `distrib/${MACHINE}/README.md`
for [stm32][7] and [pic32][8].
